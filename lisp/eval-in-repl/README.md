**eval-in-repl: Consistent ESS-like eval interface for various REPLs**
--------------------

This package does what ESS does for R for various REPLs, including ielm.

Emacs Speaks Statistics (ESS) package has a nice function called ess-eval-region-or-line-and-step, which is assigned to C-RET. This function sends a line or a selected region to the corresponding shell (R, Julia, Stata, etc) visibly. It also start up a shell if there is none.

This package implements similar work flow for various read-eval-print-loops (REPLs) shown below.


**Usage**
--------------------

After installation and appropriate configuration (see below), you can use C-RET in a source file to start up an appropriate REPL and evaluate a line, selected region or the current expression depending on the context. The script will be shown on the right, and the REPL on the left. The REPL shows both the code executed and the value the code returned.

**Installation**
--------------------

The following files are included in the package. There are respective dependencies.

- eval-in-repl.el
 - Skeleton package required for all specialized packages below.

- eval-in-repl-ielm.el
 - Support for Inferior Emacs Lisp Mode (IELM; part of default emacs installation)

- eval-in-repl-cider.el
 - Support for Clojure via cider.el (depends on cider.el)

- eval-in-repl-slime.el
 - Support for other lisps via slime.el (depends on slime.el)

- eval-in-repl-scheme.el
 - Support for Scheme via scheme.el (depends on scheme.el and cmuscheme.el; both part of default emacs installation)

- eval-in-repl-python.el
 - Support for Python via python.el (depends on python.el; part of default emacs installation)

- eval-in-repl-shell.el (depends on essh.el)
 - Support for shell via essh.el


It is planned to be available on the MELPA repository. Once it becomes available you can do the following, then choose and install eval-in-repl.

```
M-x list-packages
```

To configure the MELPA, see this: http://melpa.milkbox.net/#/getting-started


**Configuration**
--------------------

The full configuration is the following. ```eval-in-repl.el``` is always necessary. Require other files as needed and configure the respective mode-specific key bindings.

```lisp
;; require the main file containing common functions
(require 'eval-in-repl)

;; ielm
(require 'eval-in-repl-ielm)
;; For .el files
(define-key emacs-lisp-mode-map (kbd "<C-return>") 'eir-eval-in-ielm)
;; For *scratch*
(define-key lisp-interaction-mode-map (kbd "<C-return>") 'eir-eval-in-ielm)
;; For M-x info
(define-key Info-mode-map (kbd "<C-return>") 'eir-eval-in-ielm)

;; cider
(require 'cider) ; if not done elsewhere
(require 'eval-in-repl-cider)
(define-key clojure-mode-map (kbd "<C-return>") 'eir-eval-in-cider)

;; SLIME
(require 'slime) ; if not done elsewhere
(require 'eval-in-repl-slime)
(add-hook 'lisp-mode-hook
		  '(lambda ()
		     (local-set-key (kbd "<C-return>") 'eir-eval-in-slime)))

;; scheme
(require 'scheme) ; if not done elsewhere
(require 'cmuscheme) ; if not done elsewhere
(require 'eval-in-repl-scheme)
(add-hook 'scheme-mode-hook
		  '(lambda ()
		     (local-set-key (kbd "<C-return>") 'eir-eval-in-scheme)))

;; python
(require 'python) ; if not done elsewhere
(require 'eval-in-repl-python)
(define-key python-mode-map (kbd "<C-return>") 'eir-eval-in-python)

;; shell
(require 'essh) ; if not done elsewhere
(require 'eval-in-repl-shell)
(add-hook 'sh-mode-hook
          '(lambda()
		     (local-set-key (kbd "C-<return>") 'eir-eval-in-shell)))
```

**Known issues**
--------------------

- The first invocation of a cider REPL is slow and sometimes fails.
- If there is no \*cider-repl\*, but \*nrepl-...\* buffers, the latter are killed. This behavior may not be safe.
- The Python version does not work on the very last block in the file if there is no newline character at the end.


**Version histoy**
--------------------

- 2014-07-06 0.1.1 Delete excess autoload macros, add paredit.el to dependency
- 2014-06-30 0.1.0 First MELPA Release
