;;; Commentary:

;; eval-in-repl: Consistent ESS-like eval interface for various REPLs
;;
;; This package does what ESS does for R for various REPLs, including ielm.
;;
;; Emacs Speaks Statistics (ESS) package has a nice function called
;; ess-eval-region-or-line-and-step, which is assigned to C-RET.
;; This function sends a line or a selected region to the corresponding
;; shell (R, Julia, Stata, etc) visibly. It also start up a shell if
;; there is none.
;;
;; This package along with REPL/shell specific packages implement similar
;; work flow for various REPLs.
;;
;; This file alone is not functional. Also require the following depending
;; on your needs.
;;
;; eval-in-repl-ielm.el    for Emacs Lisp (via ielm)
;; eval-in-repl-cider.el   for Clojure (via cider.el)
;; eval-in-repl-slime.el   for SLIME (via slime.el)
;; eval-in-repl-scheme.el  for Scheme (via scheme.el and cmuscheme.el)
;; eval-in-repl-python.el  for Python (via python.el)
;; eval-in-repl-shell.el   for shell mode (via essh.el)
;;
;; See the URL below for installation and configuration instructions.
;; https://github.com/kaz-yos/eval-in-repl/
;;
;; Known issues
;; - The first invocation of a cider REPL is slow and sometimes fails.
;; - If there is no *cider-repl*, but *nrepl-...* buffers, the latter are
;;   killed. This behavior may not be safe.
;; - The Python version does not work on the very last block in the file
;;   if there is no newline character at the end.
